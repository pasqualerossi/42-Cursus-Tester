All of the following steps below are in Shell. 

### 1. Copy and paste the following in shell -

``vim script.sh``

### 3.  In the vim script.h file, under the #Libs locations (3rd Row Down from the top of the script.h file), change the path description to your own Libft, Get_Next_Line or Printf folder.

### 4. Then exit vim (``wq``) and type in the shell the following command -

```make <the project name that your working on>```  to run the 42-Cursus-Tester. 

eg. ```make printf```

To see only the required functions and not the bonus, type in the following - 

```make <the project name that your working on> Manditory``` to run the 42-Cursus-Tester without the bonus.

eg. ```make printf Manditory```

### 5. Check your results and good luck!
